# Animeify API Configuration
# Base URL for the Animeify API (default: https://animeify.net/animeify/apis_v4/)
# When deployed, the Next.js app uses an API proxy route (/api/animeify) to avoid CORS issues
# This proxy forwards requests from the client to animeify.net with proper CORS headers
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://animeify.net/animeify/apis_v4/

# API Token for authentication
# Note: This is a public token extracted from the decompiled Animeify v3.0.9 Android app
# It is used for anonymous/guest access to the API
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_TOKEN=8cnY80AZSbUCmR26Vku1VUUY4

# Optional: Use Cloudflare Worker as proxy instead of Next.js API route
# Deploy the worker from /worker directory first: cd worker && npx wrangler deploy
# Then set this to your worker URL to bypass the Next.js proxy
# NEXT_PUBLIC_WORKER_URL=https://witanime-api-worker.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev
